// 00 - FUNDAMENTALS
//
// In this module, you will learn the fundamental syntax of Rust, without going into
// any real depth on the semantics of the language.
//
// After completing this module, you will be able to look at Rust code and mentally
// decompose it into its constituent parts, identifying the major components, such
// as literals, expressions, functions, traits, and so on.

/// VARIABLES
///
/// A variable is a name that refers to a value. In Rust, variables are immutable by
/// default, and must be explicitly marked as mutable. Variables can be declared with
/// the `let` keyword, and can be annotated with a type, or have their type inferred
/// by the compiler.

///
/// A literal is a fixed value that appears directly in source code. In Rust, literals

/// characters, strings, byte strings, arrays, tuples, and unit.
